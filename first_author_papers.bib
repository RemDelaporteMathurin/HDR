  abstract = {The Advanced LOwer Hybrid Antenna (ALOHA) code, has been developed to improve the modelling of the coupling of lower hybrid (LH) waves from the antenna to a cold inhomogeneous plasma while keeping a fast tool. In contrast to the previous code Slow Wave ANtenna (SWAN) (that only described the interaction of the slow wave between the waveguides and the plasma in a 1D model), the equations are now solved in 2D including the contribution of both the slow and fast waves, with a low computational cost. This approach is completed either by a full-wave computation of the antenna that takes into account its detailed geometry or by a mode-matching code dedicated to multijunctions modelling, which is convenient in preliminary design phases. Moreover, ALOHA can treat more realistic scrape-off layers in front of the antenna, by using a two-layer electron density profile. The ALOHA code has been compared with experimental results from Tore Supra LH antennas of different geometries, as well as benchmarked against other LH coupling codes, with very good results. Once validated, ALOHA has been used as a support for the design of COMPASS and ITER LH antennas and has shown to be a fast and reliable tool for LH antenna design.},

In order to achieve the conditions similar to those expected in an electricity-generating fusion power plant, plasmas with a temperature of several hundreds of millions of degrees must be generated and sustained for long periods. For this purpose, RF antennas delivering multi-megawatts of power to magnetized confined plasma are commonly used in experimental tokamaks. In the gigahertz range of frequencies, high power phased arrays known as ``Lower Hybrid'' (LH) antennas are used to extend the plasma duration.

  abstract = {The sustainment of steady-state plasmas in tokamaks requires efficient current drive systems. Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) is currently the most efficient method to generate a continuous additional off-axis toroidal plasma current as well as reduce the poloidal flux consumption during the plasma current ramp-up phase. The operation of the Tore Supra ITER-like LH launcher and 700kW CW klystrons have demonstrated the ability to couple LH power at ITER-like power densities with very low reflected power during long pulses. However, in order to achieve pure stationary LH sustained plasmas, some R\&D are needed to increase the reliability of all the systems and codes, from the RF sources to the plasma scenario prediction. The CEA/IRFM is addressing some of these issues by leading a R\&D program toward an ITER LH system and by the validation of an integrated LH modeling suite of codes. In 2011, the RF design of a mode converter has been validated at low power. A 500 kW/5 s RF window is currently under manufacturing and will be tested at high power in 2012 in collaboration with NFRI. All of this work aims to reduce the operational risks associated with the ITER steady-state operations.},

The window design rely on a symmetrical pill-box concept with a cylindrical beryllium oxide ceramic brazed on an actively water cooled copper skirt. The ceramic RF properties have been measured on a test sample to get realistic values for guiding the design. Low power measurements of the manufactured windows show return losses below -32 dB and insertion losses between -0.01 dB and -0.05 dB, with an optimum frequency shifted toward lower frequencies. High power tests conducted at NFRI show unexpected total power loss for both windows. The ceramic temperature during RF pulses has been found to reach unexpected high temperature, preventing these windows to be used under CW conditions. A post-mortem RF analysis of samples taken from one window shows that the dielectric properties of the ceramic were not the ones measured on the manufacturer sample, which partly explain the differences with the reference modelling.},

They have to withstand a peak RF current up to 2.5 kA at 55 MHz in steady-state conditions, in the vacuum environment of the machine. The contacts have to sustain a temperature up to 250 {$\smwhtcircle$}C during several days in baking operations and have to be reliable during the whole life of the launcher without degradation. The RF contacts are critical components for the launcher performance and intensive R\&D is therefore required, since no RF contacts have so far been qualified at these specifications. In order to test and validate the anticipated RF contacts in operational conditions, CEA has prepared a test platform consisting of a steady-state vacuum pumped RF resonator. In collaboration with ITER Organization and the CYCLE consortium (CYclotron CLuster for Europe), an R\&D program has been conducted to develop RF contacts that meet the ITER ICRH launcher specifications. A design proposed by CYCLE consortium, using brazed lamellas supported by a spring to improve thermal exchange efficiency while guaranteeing high contact force, was tested successfully in the Tresonator up to 1.7 kA during 1200 s, but failed for larger current values due to a degradation of the contacts. Details concerning the manufacturing of the brazed contacts on its titanium holder, the RF tests results performed on the resonator and the non-destructive tests analysis of the contacts are given in this paper.},

  abstract = {Magnetic confinement fusion researches are an approach to demonstrate the feasibility of nuclear fusion power for energy production. In these experiments, mega-watt range power Radio-Frequency waves, from tens of MHz to hundreds of GHz, are injected into magnetically confined plasmas in order to increase its temperature and to extend its duration. These RF systems are subjected to the magnetic field environment of the experiments, ranging from few tenth of Tesla to Tesla, and various orientations depending of their locations. As these RF systems made of copper, silver or ceramics are located in vacuum environments, they are subject to multipactor discharges. These discharges are generally considered detrimental since they can lead to detuned RF systems, limit the RF power transmission in the plasma and eventually damage RF sources or components. In some case, especially in the MHz range of frequency, multipactor discharges can be desired for vacuum conditioning. This paper presents the various RF systems used in magnetic fusion experiments and review the work performed in the fusion research community on multipactor discharges for high power coaxial (MHz) and rectangular waveguides (GHz) transmission lines, with their practical implications on power delivery into the plasma.},

Radio-Frequency (RF) contacts are integrated within the ITER ICRH launcher in order to ensure the RF current continuity and ease the mechanical assembly by allowing the free thermal expansion of the Removable Vacuum Transmission Line coaxial conductors during RF operations or during 250 \textdegree C baking phases. A material study has been carried out to determine which materials and associated coatings are relevant for RF contacts application in ITER. In parallel, RF tests have been performed with a new prototype of Multi-Contact\textregistered{} LA-CUT/0,25/0 contacts made of silver-coated CuCrZr louvers. During these tests on a RF vacuum resonator, currents between 1.2 kA and 1.3 kA peak have been reached a few tens of times in steady-state conditions without any visible damage on the louvers. A final 62 MHz pulse ending in a 300 s flat top at 1.9 kA resulted in severe damage to the contact. In addition, a test bed which performs sliding test cycles has been built in order to reproduce the wear of the contact prototype after 30 000 sliding cycles on a 3 mm stroke at 175 \textdegree C under vacuum. The silver coating of the louvers is removed after approximately a hundred cycles whilst, to the contrary, damage to the CuCrZr louvers is relatively low.},

  abstract = {The coupling between cold magnetized plasmas with lower hybrid resonance frequency antennas is generally addressed using specifically developed codes. These antenna coupling codes often approximate the plasma to a surface impedance described by a 1D half infinite models and antennas either with simplified 2D dimensions or from 3D CAD models conversion. Such approaches add an additional step of model approximation/conversion which is not convenient to rapidly assess impact of geometry changes on coupling performances. In this work, we assess the ability of using ANSYS HFSS to describe the usual range of experimental magnetized cold plasma inhomogeneous parameters facing LHRF antennas, away from resonances, in order to guide the RF designer during the design phase of an antenna. The coupling calculations of Lower Hybrid Resonance Frequency antennas are performed and successfully benchmarked with the fast coupling codes ALOHA on inhomogeneous cold magnetized plasmas. Good agreements are obtained when the boundary conditions in the full-wave modelling are properly handled. Practical advices and limitations are given in order to define correctly these boundary conditions and insure correct results.},

Such kinds of RF systems being rather rare, Master's students do not know how these systems are used in practice \textendash{} even students engaged in nuclear fusion courses. This is the reason why, as part of the French and European Master's in fusion physics and technologies, dedicated practical work on topics related to plasma RF heating are proposed to students. Over a few days, these students discover how to perform RF measurements and succeed in characterizing real-scale components used in plasma RF heating experiments. This paper details four hands-on approaches which have been conducted over eight years with several tens of students having no prior knowledge in RF engineering.},
